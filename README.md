# Face Recognition using OpenCV

This Python project uses OpenCV to capture a face image via a webcam, and then compares the captured face to a set of reference images to find a match.

## Features

- Load reference images containing faces from a specified folder.
- Capture a face from the webcam with a 7-second delay before taking the image.
- Detect faces in the webcam feed and compare them to the reference faces.
- Print the name of the matched reference image if a face match is found.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Ensure you have the webcam connected and accessible.
